## Overview

This Project was done as part of the neuefische GmbH Bootcamp in Data Science with Python.
It is based upon a modified version of the King County Housing Pricing Dataset.
The goal of this project was to complete a full data science lifecycle and in the end be able to give recommendations to a target group (e.g investors, families who are looking to buy). 
Furthermore the students were to implement a multivariate linear regression model and try to reduce the mean absolute percentage error as much as possible.



## Repository Content

The repository contains the modifed dataset, the jupyter notebook that was written and a pdf containing all slides of the final presentation.
